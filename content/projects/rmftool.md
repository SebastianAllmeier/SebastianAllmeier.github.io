The **rmftool** is a library which aims to simplify the study and simulation of population processes, to compute their mean-field approximations and refined mean-field approximations for the transient regime as well as steady-state.

The **rmftool** is written in python and available on: 
* [Github] (An introduction and short examples are hosted in the repository.)
* [Pipy]

A paper, accepted at the _Tools for Stochastic Modelling and Evaluation_ workshop of IFIP Performance 2021 and can be found here: [Link][1]


The tool can be easily installed by using pyhtons package manager pip:
```python
pip install rmftool
```

The tool was developed by [Nicolas Gast] and myself.
